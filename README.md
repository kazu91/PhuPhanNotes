# Phu Phan Note App

A pretty simple note app demo for iOS devices

## Application Outline

I want to make a straight forward notes app for internal usage such as small team members or a small office. People can log in with their username
to create notes that other people can see it. 

Application functions:
* Log-in with username and password
* Log-out
* Show people's note
* Show user's note
* Create notes
* View other's note detail
* Delete/Update their own notes
* Save and Load data from Firestore Database

## Time Spent ~ 12 Hours
* UI Components: 4 hours
* Logics: 5 hours
* Firestore connect: 1 hours
* Testing: 1 hours

## Limitations and known issues

### Known issues

* I used firestore storage instead of real-time database.

### Limitation
* Lack of notes filters and orders 
* Can use firebase authentication instead of username password
* Better navigation
* Dont have any progress view to improve UX
